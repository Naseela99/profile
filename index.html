                    Hi! I am Naseela and welcome to my website. I want to briefly introduce myself before you give into 
                    the rest of the website. I am a computer science graduate from University of Southern California (USC). I have 
                    pursued my bachelor's from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, India. If I have to describe my journey
                    in computer science in a few words, it will be "learning multiple ways to solve a problem till you achieve effiency".
                    I have thoroughly enjoyed the courses of Algorithm Analysis and Design, Information Retrieval, Foundation of Artificial
                    Intelligence, Applied Natural Language Processing and Database Management Systems during my master's. During my undergraduate,
                    I have taken the course of Web Development and ever since I have been updating my front-end and back-end technologies. This website
                    is vanilla in many sense - it uses the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript and I built it to showcase my skills and projects in 
                    fullstack as well as machine learning. 

                    
        
            


                </p>

                <p class="about-para">

                    Currently, I am working on updating my skills in DevOps and MLOps and learning Docker and Kubernetes. I am also
                    looking at updating my front-end skills and work on a project in vuw. Furthermore, I love researching on 
                    intersection of human psychology and natural language processing. While actively looking for new roles in software
                    development, full-stack or machine learning, what keeps me sane is my passion for skill enhancement and development 
                    in every aspect of life.

                    


                </p>

                <p class="about-para">

                    Being passionate and artistic, I love making new goals and following through on them. So much so that some poeple say that I 
                    micromanage my life. Journally and spending my morning to plan out my day is the best time I spend with myself. I immensely enjoy
                    cooking, brewing coffee, swimming and crochetting.

                    Through analytics and automation, I optimized library costs and services. By creating Tableau dashboards to analyze vendor usage patterns, I identified opportunities to consolidate suppliers. This drove a 12% reduction in per-user library spend. To modernize reporting, I scripted Python tools to auto-generate critical compliance documents. This slashed associated labor costs by 55% and sped up report delivery to stakeholders by 65%. My analysis of usage patterns across student segments revealed redundancies and high-spend accounts. The data-driven insights allowed improved targeting of resources. As a result, I achieved a 12% reduction in per-user usage costs. Overall, my initiatives improved efficiency, accelerated workflows, and delivered substantial cost optimization for library services.

This enabled training of a depression detection model suited to pandemic contexts. I developed a BERT classification model to detect signals of depression in tweets, achieving 87% accuracy. Compared to pre-pandemic datasets, my model showed a 25% increase in depression signals, revealing significant mental health effects of COVID-19. As first author, I drove the direction of this tweet classification research and authored critical sections of a conference paper detailing the methodology and findings. I presented this work at the 2022 International Conference on Textual Information Systems, highlighting my capabilities in leading impactful NLP projects from data collection through publication.

                        The weather application allows users to enter a city name and see live 
                        weather data for that location. When the user enters a city, the application 
                        makes a request to the OpenWeather API to fetch the current weather data for 
                        that city.

                        The OpenWeather API returns a JSON object containing information
                         like temperature, humidity, weather
                        description, etc. The application parses this JSON data to display 
                        the temperature, humidity and "feels like" temperature on the page.

                        To make the background match the weather, the application also makes
                         a request to the Giphy API to fetch a weather-related gif. The Giphy 
                         API is searched with keywords related to the current weather 
                         (e.g. "rainy", "sunny") and returns gif URLs in a JSON object.
                          The application picks one of these Giphy gif URLs and sets it as 
                          the page background.

                        Applied Lime and Shap explainable AI techniques to diverse classification models including Random Forest,
                         Logistic Regression, and SVM to assess personality traits based on the Big Five model, IRI-based empathy/distress traits,
                         and MFT-based morality traits. Identified 50% of the most influential words in the original text using Lime and Shap and 
                         then conducted a comprehensive analysis utilizing statistical evaluations to compare established LIWC features
                         between the original and transformed texts comprising those influential words. 
                         The analysis revealed a lack of statistically significant associations between therotically established groundtruths of psychology
                         community  - LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) features and the text when 
                         reduced to the influential words highlighted by Lime and Shap.
                          This provided insights into feature interpretability in text analysis within the various classification models.
                          Overall, determined through the statistical tests that the established LIWC features did not have a statistically 
                          significant relationship to the transformed text with 50% of the most influential words. This sheds light on the role 
                          of feature interpretability in text classification tasks using different models when the text is reduced to its most 
                          influential components identified by Lime and Shap.

                        A hybrid recommendation system was developed to 
                        predict user ratings for restaurants by employing a 
                        weighted average approach that combined an item-based 
                        collaborative filtering recommender using Pearson 
                        correlation similarity with an XGBoost regressor model. 
                        The item-based collaborative filtering component generated 
                        recommendations based on similarity of rating patterns 
                        between different restaurants, while the XGBoost regressor
                         predicted numeric rating values. By combining these two 
                         components using a weighted average ensembling approach, 
                         the hybrid model achieved an RMSE of 0.97 on the prediction
                          task, demonstrating improved accuracy over a baseline model 
                          RMSE of 1.09. This hybrid integration of collaborative filtering 
                          and regression techniques enabled more robust and accurate rating 
                          predictions. To optimize the runtime performance of the 
                          recommendation system, PySpark RDD APIs were leveraged to 
                          distribute the data processing and model training. 
                          The Spark RDDs allowed parallelization of computations 
                          across clusters, significantly speeding up the processing 
                          time for the dataset containing 3 million rows of
                           user-restaurant ratings. The use of PySpark reduced the 
                           total runtime from approximately 7200 seconds in the
                           original configuration to just 1800 seconds after 
                           optimization, underscoring a 4x improvement in processing 
                           time. This considerable enhancement in efficiency enabled 
                           more rapid iteration during model development and 
                           facilitated application of the system to larger real-world 
                           datasets. Overall, the PySpark implementation delivered 
                           substantial gains in scalability and speed for the 
                           recommendation engine.

                <div class="project-description">
                    An AI agent was architected to play the 5x5 Chinese board game 
                    Little Go, achieving over 90% win rates against benchmark 
                    opponents. This was accomplished by developing a Minimax 
                    search algorithm with Alpha Beta Pruning in Python to explore 
                    future game states and select optimal moves.

                    The Minimax search algorithm modeled the two-player game as 
                    adversarial search, evaluating possible future game states up 
                    to a depth of 13 moves. It assigned maximizing and minimizing 
                    scores to the AI agent's and opponent's possible moves using a
                     heuristic evaluation function. Alpha Beta Pruning was 
                     implemented to prune away branches that were guaranteed to be 
                     worse than already explored options, increasing search 
                     efficiency.

                    The heuristic evaluation function was designed through 
                    iterative testing and tuning, incorporating factors such 
                    as number of stable pieces, liberties, and territory to 
                    estimate the value of board positions. The agent's opening book 
                    and endgame databases were also optimized by analyzing patterns 
                    in winning games.

                    By effectively combining the optimized Minimax search with powerful 
                    heuristics, domain-specific adaptations, and move precomputations, 
                    the AI agent was able to successfully evaluate complex positions 
                    and make tactically strong moves. The over 90% win rate demonstrated 
                    the agent's proficiency in strategic decision-making and planning to 
                    achieve victory. The specialized techniques developed could 
                    generalize to building AI for other complex board games.

                    This book records web application is a project from The Odin Project curriculum. It allows users to add and keep track of books they have read or want to read.

The application displays a list of book titles and authors that the user has entered. It ensures no duplicate book entries are created. Users can add a new book by entering the title and author. They can also delete existing books from the list.

The list is persisted in the browser's local storage so it is saved between sessions.

This project focuses on practicing JavaScript skills like working with arrays, objects, and local storage. Since responsive design is not a requirement for this project, the site layout is not optimized for mobile devices. The intent is to demonstrate core functionality like dynamically adding and removing books from the list.

As part of The Odin Project's full stack JavaScript path, this project gives hands-on experience with vanilla JS without relying on external libraries or frameworks. Over the course of the curriculum, more complex features and responsiveness will be incrementally added to this book records application.
